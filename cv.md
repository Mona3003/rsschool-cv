### About me

I'm 33 years old and my interest in the IT profession of "Frontend Developer" began this summer when I wrote my first "Hello World" during a 1-month introductory course at Hexlet online school. Discovering the fascinating and challenging nature of this field, I made the decision to transition from being a maternity worker to pursuing a career as a web developer. My next step involved delving into HTML and CSS at RedRover School. There, I concentrated on problem-solving through Codewars to enhance my understanding of JavaScript mechanics.
